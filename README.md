**Case Study**

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this test is to evaluate your analytical abilities. A case study is an integral part while selecting candidates for an engineering post. It allows the candidates to experience situations that they might actually face in the current world. When responding to the questions, add the source code you used to derive the answer.

**Scenario:**

1. Suppose You have a Json file: **pos\_0.png.json**. Your job is to write a python script that will convert this format into a standard format : **formatted\_pos\_0.png.json**

\*\*note: object attribute (presence) will be dependent on if the class(vehicle or license plate) is present on the raw json. If both the classes are missing look at the example **Formatted\_pos\_10492.png.json**

You may test out your code with the following jsons: Pos\_0.png.json

Pos\_10010.png.json

Pos\_10492.png.json

2. Write a python that can combine the test jsons (Pos\_0.png.json,Pos\_10010.png.json, Pos\_10492.png.json) into a single json file and then change the class names into: vehicle>car, license plate >number

**NO 2 is mandatory to finish.**
